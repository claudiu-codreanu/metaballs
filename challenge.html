            Dear recreational coding club members!
        </p>

        <p>
            Happy Friday! We hope you had a nice and productive week at work and now you’re looking forward to a nice
            and entertaining weekend. For this reason, please allow us to add to your entertainment sources a new recreational coding challenge!
        </p>

        <h2>
            Coding Challenge

        <p>
            This weekend we’re serving metaballs! This is not a fancy dish, but a computer visualization that you can do
            in JavaScript on a canvas! All the ingredients are included with your computer, while the steps are provided below:
        </p>

        <ul>

            <li>
                Setup yourself a nice canvas of a decent resolution. Try a smaller resolution first since this program
                will run pretty "hot" on resources.
            </li>

            <li>
                Consider a few virtual balls that are bouncing around the screen (balls are virtual – you don’t need to
                render them). These balls will have their centers at <code>(x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>)</code> and radius
                <code>r</code>.
            </li>

            <li>
                For each frame, calculate the result of the following formula for each pixel <code>(x, y)</code> in the
                frame. In this formula the <code>x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub></code> are the coordinates of the virtual balls,
                and <code>r</code> their radius.

                <figure>
                    <img alt="Pixel forumla image" src="img/formula.jpg">
                    <figCaption>Pixel Formula</figCaption>
                </figure>

                Since you’re looping over all pixels of canvas in a frame, your CPU will get hot! Choose a decently
                small size, to prevent overheating!
            </li>

            <li>
                Map the result of this function to a color Hue and plot the pixel!
                You need to work in HSL / HSV mode instead of RGB. Set the Saturation and Lightness to constant value
                (maximum) and then just manipulate the Hue.
                (Hue goes from <code>0</code> to <code>360</code>… therefore map the above sum to the
                <code>0...360</code> interval)

            </li>

            <li>
                Tune the parameters to change the visualization:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We suggest to change the radius of virtual balls … try something small, then something gigantic!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You can also try to change the mapping of the sum to the color for a totally different effect.
                        Instead of mapping to <code>0...360</code>, map to a different interval.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Try also to increase the canvas. If program becomes slow, use small "rectangles" or "circles"
                        instead of pixels, in order to keep the discrete resolution low on a big canvas.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

        </ul>
